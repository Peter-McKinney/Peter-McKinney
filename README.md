💻 Developer | ⚙️ CLI Enthusiast | 🛠️ [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) & [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) Tinkerer 

I'm a software developer passionate about clean code, process automation, neovim, and tmux. You'll often find me optimizing my workflow with custom bash scripts, cli tools, tmux plugins, or neovim plugins. If I have to do it more than once, I'm probably thinking about automating it 😅
